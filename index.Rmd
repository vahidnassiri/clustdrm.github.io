The R package `clustDRM` implements the methods discussed in this guideline.
There are three main functionalities considered in this package:

* clustering dose-response data based on their pattern
* Fitting models to dose-response data based on a given pattern
* Perform simulations based on a pilot dataset to find the best combination of
  dose-levels/number of replication per dose.
  
The following we try to go over each of this examples. For the sake of
illustration, a small part of the DILI dataset discussed this guideline is
selected.
